        <h2>Relevant Experience</h2>
        <hr>
        <h3>Using models</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I have used many machine learning models on my own computer from YoloV10 and Mistral 7B</li>
            <li>My main library for machine learning has been Tensorflow which I have been running on my RTX 3070, I have done computer vision and natural language processing</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Understaning the concepts</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>To ensure I have the knowledge for any problem, I have built many deep learning models with onlu Numpy, from MLPs, CNNs, RNNs, Adversarial Networks, and simple LSTMs</li>
            <li>Gaining information about basic algorithms has also been a focus for me, I have learnt a couple clustering algotihsm, like K-means clustering, and Nearest-Neighor algorithm</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Data preprocessing</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Through reading a book named "Hands-on Machine Learning", and through doing various projects on kaggle, using sci-kit learn; I used lots of preprocessing techniques like inputting missing data and 1-hot encoding any text data</li>
            <li> Through solving kaggle problems, I have built and applied lots of preprocessing pipelines</li>
        </ul>
